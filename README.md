# fibaro-config
Keeping track of my config and related tools

# Scripts

Scripts for now are not packages, just quickies. This means that any py deps has to be taken care of manually.

# Notes

Currently this very minimal, however I do accept pull requests if someone has anything that would be useful here, or would like to extend the functionality of current scripts.
